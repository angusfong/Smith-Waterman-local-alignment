# Smith-Waterman-local-alignment
This is a Python implementation for locally aligning two molecular sequences, as a class assignment for CBB 752 - Biomedical Data Science: Mining and Modeling, at Yale University.

##Files:
sample-input.txt contains two input sequences<br />
blosum62.txt contains the similarity matrix for every pair of units<br />
output.txt contains the example output of the algorithm from the given input files<br />
smith-waterman.py contains the source code for the implementation<br />

##Usage:
python hw1.py -i input.txt -s blosum62.txt
